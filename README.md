## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed invalid transactions (zero price & refunds).
   - Converted dates to datetime format and created a `Revenue` column.
   - Engineered time-based features (Year, Month, Weekday, Hour, YearMonth).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Sales trends over time.
   - Geographic and product-level breakdowns.
   - Customer purchasing patterns.

3. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Checked stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
   - Analyzed autocorrelation (ACF) & partial autocorrelation (PACF).
   - Compared **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** models for monthly revenue forecasting.

4. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
   - Applied K-Means clustering on normalized RFM scores.
   - Grouped customers into segments for targeted business strategies.

5. **Visualization & Dashboard**
   - Created interactive Power BI dashboard with filters, slicers, and key metrics.
   - Added geographic sales maps, product rankings, and customer segments.
